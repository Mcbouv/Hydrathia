This is a simple text file explaining the Hydrathia App

Hydrathia app uses two main technologies:
Android Alarm Manager
Flutter Local Push Notifications

The Alarm Manager ensures that notifications are pushed even when the user has not opened the app
in a long time as long as it is installed.
It has its limitations on some devices such Samsung has its own policy on background Alarms, Hauwei too.
More info on the official documentation.

Flutter Local Push Notifications just pushes notifications as instructed by the Alarm Manager.
https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications
version 1.4.4+1

Take a look at these functions:

alarm7Days(Plant plant) async {
  await AndroidAlarmManager.periodic(
      const Duration(days: 7),
      // Ensure we have a unique alarm ID.
      Random().nextInt(pow(2, 31).toInt()),
      showNotification(id: plant.id),
      exact: true,
      wakeup: true,         //wakes up the CPU in case phone is in StandBy mode
      rescheduleOnReboot: true);
}

alarm12Days(Plant plant) async {
  await AndroidAlarmManager.periodic(
      const Duration(days: 12),
      // Ensure we have a unique alarm ID.
      Random().nextInt(pow(2, 31).toInt()),
      showNotification(id: plant.id),
      exact: true,
      wakeup: true,
      rescheduleOnReboot: true);
}


To wrap it up, Hydrathia is implemented in MVC architecture that is, 
Model - Plant model
View - Home.dart, Single_plant.dart
Controller - readJson.dart, (also some functions in main.dart)
